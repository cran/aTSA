Performs an approximate Cox-Stuart or Difference-Sign trend test.

\details{
Cox-Stuart or Difference-Sign test is used to test whether the data have a
increasing or decreasing trend. They are useful to detect the linear or nonlinear trend.
The Cox-Stuart test is constructed as follows.
For the given data \eqn{x[1],...,x[t]}, one can divide them into two sequences with
equal number of observations cutted in the midpoint and then take the paired difference,
i.e., \eqn{D = x[i] - x[i+c], i = 1, ..., floor(n/2)}, where \eqn{c} is the index of
midpoint. Let \eqn{S} be the number of positive or negative values in \eqn{D}. Under the
null hypothesis that data have no trend, for large \eqn{n} = length(x), \eqn{S} is
approximately distributed as \eqn{N(n/2,n/4)}, such that one can immediately obtain
the p value. The exact Cox-Stuart trend test can be seen in \code{\link[snpar]{cs.test}} of
\code{snpar} package.

The Difference-Sign test is constructed as the similar way as Cox-Stuart test. We first
let \eqn{D = x[i] - x[i - 1]} for \eqn{i = 2, ..., n} and then
count the number of positive or negative values in \eqn{D}, defined as \eqn{S}.
Under the null hypothesis, \eqn{S} is approximately distributed as
\eqn{N((n-1)/2,(n+1)/12)}. Thus, p-value can be calculated based on the null distribution.

\examples{
x <- rnorm(100)
trend.test(x,plot = TRUE) # no trend

x <- 5*(1:100)/100
x <- x + arima.sim(list(order = c(1,0,0),ar = 0.4),n = 100)
trend.test(x,plot = TRUE) # increasing trend
